# C-Polynomial-Derivative
This repository contains a C program that calculates the derivative of a polynomial entered by the user. The program prompts the user to enter the degree of the polynomial and its coefficients. It then calculates the derivative of the polynomial using the power rule of differentiation and outputs the resulting polynomial. Finally, the user can input a value for x, and the program calculates the value of the derivative at that point.

# Usage
To run the program, simply compile and execute the polynomial_derivative.c file. The program will prompt you to enter the degree of the polynomial and its coefficients. Once you have entered the coefficients, the program will calculate the derivative of the polynomial and output the resulting polynomial. Finally, the program will prompt you to enter a value for x, and it will calculate the value of the derivative at that point.

# Dependencies
This program requires the stdio.h and math.h header files.
